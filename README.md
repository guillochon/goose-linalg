# linalg

Dense real linear algebra for [Goose](https://aardappel.github.io/goose/), in pure Goose: no C, no
build step, nothing to install.

```goose
import linalg from "you/linalg@v0.1";     // or from "../linalg" for a local checkout

fn main() {
    let a = linalg::from_rows(3, 3, [4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 0, 5]);
    let x, ok = linalg::solve(a, [1, 2, 3]);
    print(a, " det ", linalg::det(a), " x ", x);
}
```

## Conventions

- A `linalg::matrix` is `{ rows, cols, data: f64[>..] }`, row-major. Vectors are plain f64
  arrays: functions take any array kind as `f64[:]` and return `f64[>..]`.
- Functions that only **read** a matrix take an untyped parameter, so both named matrices (passed
  by reference, never copied) and temporaries work: `linalg::matmul(a, linalg::transpose(a))`.
- Functions that **change** a matrix take `matrix&`; pass a variable.
- Results are built straight into the caller's variable. Decompositions with several outputs write
  into variables you pass, LAPACK style; their previous contents don't matter:
  `var q = linalg::zeros(0, 0); var r = linalg::zeros(0, 0); linalg::qr(a, q, r);`
- To update a matrix from itself, compute into a new variable and assign a copy: `let t =
  linalg::matmul(acc, a); acc = copy(t);` (Goose builds an array's new contents in place, so
  `acc = matmul(acc, a)` is rejected.)
- Shape mismatches and out-of-range indices abort. Numerical failure (singular, not positive
  definite, rank deficient, not converged) comes back as a trailing `bool`.
- Everything is in namespace `linalg`. Goose's UFCS doesn't cross namespaces, so write
  `linalg::trace(a)`, not `a.trace()`.
- A literal's first element sets its type: `[1, 2.5]` is an integer literal and won't compile as
  `f64[:]`. Write `[1.0, 2.5]`. Literals that are all integers, like `[1, 2, 3]`, adapt to `f64`
  fine.

| Cholesky | `cholesky(a) -> l, ok`, `cholesky_solve(l, b)` |
| QR | `qr(a, q&, r&)` (Householder, any shape), `lstsq(a, b) -> x, ok` |
| Symmetric eigen | `eigh(a, values&, vectors&) -> converged` (Jacobi, ascending), `eigvals_sym(a)` |
| SVD | `svd(a, u&, s&, v&) -> converged` (thin, one-sided Jacobi, descending), `singular_values`, `rank(a, tol)`, `pinv(a, tol)` |

## Algorithms and accuracy

- `lu_factor` uses partial pivoting. `det` and `solve` are built on it.
- `qr` uses Householder reflections. `lstsq` solves through QR and refuses rank-deficient input
  rather than returning garbage.
- `eigh` uses cyclic Jacobi rotations and `svd` uses one-sided (Hestenes) Jacobi. Both are
  simple, robust, and accurate to working precision, small singular values included. Each sweep
  costs O(n³), so they're right for matrices up to a few hundred rows. They aren't a replacement
  for LAPACK on big problems.
- `svd` always returns orthonormal `u` and `v`, completing the basis when the matrix is rank
  deficient.

## Tests

```bash
goose test/test_linalg.goose
```

The suite runs 988 checks and exits 1 on any failure. It has two kinds of checks:
- **Exact cases worked by hand:** the Hilbert inverse, a textbook Cholesky factor, Fibonacci
  through `power`, and the path-graph Laplacian spectrum.
- **Identities on random matrices:** checked at sizes 1–29, square, tall and wide. These cover
  `p a = l u`, `q r = a` with `q` orthogonal, `a v = v diag(w)`, `u s vᵀ = a`, the four
  Moore-Penrose conditions, `det(ab) = det(a) det(b)`, and more.

The suite passes both in-process and in a native MSVC build. It was also mutation-tested: 16 bugs
were planted in the library one at a time, and every one was caught.

`examples/fit.goose` fits a polynomial by least squares and finds a point cloud's principal axes.
